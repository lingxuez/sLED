# sLED: A two-sample test for high-dimensional differential matrices

## sLED
Suppose X, Y are p-dimensional random vectors independently coming from two populations.
Let D be the differential matrix

D = A(Y) - A(X)

where A() is some p-by-p relationship matrix among features in the two populations, including the covariance matrices and correlation matrices. 

sLED is a powerful procedure to test the following hypothesis:

H_0: D=0 versus H_1: D \neq 0

and to identify the non-zero entries if the null hypothesis is rejected.
